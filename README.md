# **BOOK_API Django REST Framework**

Django - Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-view-controller architectural pattern.

This project is the backend API for a frontend React project https://github.com/PatrickCoakley23/book_frontend

## Containerized Applications
I have added ./docker_build.sh and ./docker_run.sh shell scripts, users have to simply use a cli with Docker installed 

1. `./docker_build.sh` to build the docker image 

2. `.docker_build.sh` to run the container 

3. React app will be available in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
